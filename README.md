## Overview

**Aqua MP3 Player** is a lightweight, retro-inspired Windows desktop audio player built with **C# WinForms** and **NAudio**.

The visual and interaction design is inspired by **Makoto Yuki’s MP3 player from _Persona 3_**—that translucent, late-2000s vision of personal audio where music felt deliberate and physical. This project translates that feeling into a functional desktop application, without imitation or excess.

The interface uses a **transparent background**, allowing it to float naturally above the desktop—present when needed, invisible when not.

## Overview

**Aqua MP3 Player** is a lightweight, retro-inspired Windows desktop audio player built with **C# WinForms** and **NAudio**.

Its visual and interaction design is inspired by **Makoto Yuki’s MP3 player from _Persona 3_**—a translucent, late-2000s vision of personal audio where music felt deliberate, physical, and private.

The interface uses a **transparent background**, allowing it to float naturally above the desktop without demanding attention.

No external data collection.

The counter exists as a quiet acknowledgment of use—not a metric to optimize.
